Python tools to control gpio pins on pl2303, cp210x and (maybe) others.


[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3qvj0prnqc2ebnje/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nekromant/pygpiotools/branch/master)

# Introduction

Remember those cheap usb-to-uart modules that have gpio pins? Want to
control them from your app in linux, windows and (hopefully) mac. Old
pl2303gpio doesn’t get the job done? This library aims to fix the
problems.

# Hardware support matrix

| Chip(s)   | Driver | Windows | Linux | Mac OS |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| PL2303HXA | pl2303 | Yes     | Yes   | Maybe  |
| CP210x    | cp210x | WiP     | Yes   | Maybe  |
|           |        |         |       |        |


# Installation

## Requirements

Any recent python 3.x. 3.7 and above should be good. Please report you
successes so that I can add the information here.

Linux (and mac, perhaps) versions need pyusb. Windows versions need
Visual Studio Build Tools installed. It’s a huge download, but it’s
needed. Grab it at [Microsoft download
site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017).

## Building Installing python module

    pip install .

This library will be uploaded to pypy once inital work and porting code
from pl2303gpio is done.

    pip install pygpiotools
